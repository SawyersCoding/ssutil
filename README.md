# ssutil

Some C++ libraries to avoid reimplementing everything all of the time.

An example of each tool can be found in the 'ex' directory.

## Objectives

- Add the ability to compile each tool (or the entire repo) into a library to make including them/it in other projects easier. 
- Add a state machine implementation.
- Add a generic factory implementation
- Add a math library including:
    - common number theory functions
    - fractions
    - complex numbers
    - vectors
    - matrices
    - quaternions
- Add an input system.
- Some optimization algorithms
